    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes new API for network sockets. Compared to classic
         BSD socket API the new API is much more leightweight and flexible.
         Its primary focus is on easy composability of network protocols.</t>

    <section title = "Introduction">
      <t>The progress in the area of network protocols is distinctively
         lagging behind. While every hobbyist new to the art of programming
         writes and publishes their small JavaScript libraries, there's no
         such thing going on with network protocols. Indeed, it looks like
         the field of network protocols is dominated by big companies and
         academia, just like programming as a whole used to be before the advent
         of personal computers.</t>
      <t>While social and political reasons may be partly to blame (adoption,
         interoperability etc.) the technology itself creates a huge barrier
         to popular participation. For example, the fact that huge part of the
         networking stack typically lives in the kernel space will prevent most
         people from even trying. More importantly though there is basically
         no way to reuse what already exists. While in JavaScript world you can
         get other people's libraries, quickly glue them together, add a bit of
         code of your own and publish a shiny new library, you can't do the same
         thing with network protocols. You can't take framing from WebSockets,
         add multihoming from SCTP, keep-alives from TCP and congestion control
         from DCCP. You have to write most of the code yourself which requires
         a lot of time, often more than a single hobbyist programmer can
         realistically afford.</t>
      <t>This memo proposes to fix the reusability problem by revamping the
         old BSD socket API and while doing so strongly focusing on
         composability of protocols.</t>
      <t>In short, the API proposed in this document doesn't try to virtualize
         all possible aspects of all possible protocols and provide a single set
         of functions to deal with all of them. Instead, it acknowledges how
         varied the protocol landscape is and how much the requirements for
         individual protocols differ. Therefore, it lets each protocol define
         its own API and asks only for bare minimum of standardised behaviour
         needed to implement protocol composability.</t>
      <t>As a consequence, the new API is much more leightweight and flexible
         than BSD socket API and allows to decompose today's monolithic protocol
         monsters into small single-purpose microprotocols that can be easily
         combined together to achieve desired functionality. </t>
      <t>The document also provides some non-binding suggestions for protocol
         API designers. Following these suggestions would lead to uniform feel
         of the APIs and flat learning curve for protocol users.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
         "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
         document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Composability">
      <t>To cover all the use cases the API has to support two distinct kinds
         of composabilty.</t>

      <section title="Vertical composability">
        <t>Vertical composability is an ability to stack protocols one on the
           top of another. From the network point of view the protocol on the
           top is a payload of the protocol on the bottom. From the API point of
           view the top protocol encapsulates the bottom protocol, very much
           like a function encapsulates another function that it calls.</t>
        <t>Example of vertical stack of protocols:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
                            +----------+
                            |   HTTP   | 
                            +----------+
                            |    TCP   |
                            +----------+
                            |    IP    |
                            +----------+
                            | Ethernet |
                            +----------+
          </artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section title="Horizontal composability">
        <t>Horizontal composability is an ability to execute protocols in
           sequential manner. From the network point of view one type of
           communication ends and is replaced by another type of communication.
           From API point of view one protocol is terminated and another one
           is started, reusing the same underlying protocol, very much like
           a function can call two nested functions in sequence without
           having to exit itself.</t>
        <t>An example of horizontal composability is how typical web page is
           trasferred by first doing HTTP handshake, followed by HTML body:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
               +-----------------------------------+
               |   HTTP   |          HTML          |
               +----------+------------------------+
               |                TCP                |
               +-----------------------------------+
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Note how this design makes protocol reusable: Same HTTP handshake
           can be used, for example, to initiate a WebSocket session.</t>
        <t>Another example of horizontal composability is how STARTTLS switches
           non-encrypted protocol into encrypted version of the same protocol.
           </t>
        <t>While these are very visible cases of composing protocols
           horizontally, the technique is in fact ubiquitous. For example,
           most protocols are composed from three distinct mini-protocols:
           protocol header (initial handshake), protocol body (sending data
           back and forth) and protocol footer (terminal handshake):</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
               +-----------------------------------+
               | Header |       Body      | Footer |
               +--------+-----------------+--------+
               |                TCP                |
               +-----------------------------------+

    <section title="Scheduling or rather lack of it">
      <t>During the decades since BSD sockets were first introduced the way they
         are used have changed significantly. While in the beginning the user
         was supposed to fork a new process for each connection and do all the
         work using simple blocking calls nowadays they are expected to keep
         a pool of connections, check them via functions like poll() or kqueue()
         and dispatch any work to be done to one of the worker threads in
         a thread pool. In other words, user is supposed to do both network and
         CPU scheduling.</t>
      <t>This change happened for performance reasons and haven't improved
         functionality or usability of BSD socket API in any way. On the
         contrary, by requiring every programmer, however junior or uninterested
         in system design topics, to do system programmer's work it contributed
         to proliferation of buggy, hard-to-debug and barely maintainable
         code.</t>
      <t>To address this problem, this memo assumes that there already exists
         an efficient concurrency implementation where forking a new lightweight
         process takes at most hundreds of nanoseconds and context switch
         takes tens of nanoseconds. Note that there are already such concurrency
         systems deployed in the wild. One well-known example are Golang's
         goroutines but there are others available as well.</t>
      <t>In such environment network programming can be done in the old
         "one process per connection" way. There's no need for polling, thread
         pools, callbacks, explicit state machines and so on.</t>
      <t>This memo thus adheres to "let system programmers do system
         programming" maxim and doesn't address the problem of scheduling,
         be it CPU scheduling or network scheduling, at all.</t>
      <t>As a footnote, it should be metioned that this proposal makes couple of
         deliberate design choices that prevent the modern "schedule by hand"
         style of network programming.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="File descriptors">
      <t>One of the design goals of this API is to support both kernel space
         and user space implementations. One problem with that is that
         kernel space objects are typically reffered to by file descriptors
         while, at the same time, there's no easy way to associate user space
         objects with file descriptors.</t>
      <t>Therefore this specification allows user space implementations
         to use fake file descriptors (simple integers that kernel space
         knows nothing about) and does not guarantee that system functions
         will work with those descriptors.</t>
      <t>For example, you cannot count on POSIX close() function to be able to
         close a socket. Therefore, hclose() function is introduced which maps
         directly to close() in kernel-space implementations but can be
         overriden by custom implementation in a user-space implementation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Socket options">
      <t>There's no equivalent to socket options as they are known from BSD
         socket API. Any such functionality is supposed to be built by vertical
         layering of protocols.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Deadlines">
        <t>Unlike with BSD sockets the deadlines are points in time rather than
           intervals. This allows to use the same deadline in multiple calls
           without need for recomputing the remaining interval:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    int64_t deadline = now() + 1000;
    bsend(h, "ABC", 3, deadline);
    bsend(h, "DEF", 3, deadline);
          </artwork>
        </figure>
    </section>

    <section title="Function prototypes">
      <t>For consistency's sake the function names SHOULD be in lowercase and
         SHOULD be composed of short protocol name and action name separated
         by underscore (e.g. "tcp_connect"). Of course, in non-C languages
         the native naming convention should be followed, but even then the name
         SHOULD contain both protocol name and action name.</t>
      <t>First argument of the function, where applicable, SHOULD be the file
         descriptor.</t>
      <t>In all blocking functions the last argument SHOULD be the deadline.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol initialization">
      <t>A protocol SHOULD be initialized using "start" function
         (e.g. "smtp_start"). If protocol runs on top of another protocol the
         file descriptor of the underlying protocol SHOULD be supplied as the
         first argument of the function. The function may have arbitrary number
         of additional arguments.</t>
      <t>The function SHOULD return the file descriptor of the newly created
         protocol instance. In case of error it SHOULD return -1 and set errno
         to the appropriate error.</t>
      <t>Some protocols require more complex setup. Consider TCP's
         listen/connect/accept connection setup process. These protocols should
         use custom set of functions rather than try to shoehorn all the
         functionality into one all-purpose "start" function.</t>
      <t>If protocol runs on top of an underlying protocol it takes ownership
         of that protocol. Using the low level protocol while it is owned by a
         higher level protocol will result in undefined behaviour.</t>
      <t>Example of creating a stack of four protocols:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
    int s1 = tcp_connect("192.168.0.111:5555");
    int s2 = foo_start(s1, arg1, arg2, arg3);
    int s3 = bar_start(s2);
    int s4 = baz_start(s3, arg4, arg5);
        </artwork>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol termination">

      <section title="Forceful termination">
        <t>Protocol descriptor is closed by hclose() function. In kernel-space
           implementations this function maps to standard POSIX close().
           The protocol MUST shut down immediately without trying to do
           termination handshake or similar. Note that this is different from
           how BSD sockets behave.</t>
        <t>The protocol MUST also clean up all resources it owns including
           closing the underlying protocol. Given that the underlying protocol
           does the same operation, an entire stack of protocols can be shut
           down recursivelly by closing the file descriptor of the topmost
           protocol:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
      int h1 = foo_start();
      int h2 = bar_start(h1);
      int h3 = baz_start(h2);
      hclose(h3); /* baz, bar and foo are shut down */
          </artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section title="Orderly termination without a handshake">
        <t>To perform an orderly shut down there SHOULD be a protocol-specific
           function called "stop". In addition to the file descriptor
           the function can have arbitrary number of other arguments.</t>
        <t>The function MUST flush any unsent data.</t>
        <t>If the shut down functionality is potentially blocking the last
           argument SHOULD be a deadline.</t>
        <t>If stop function succeeds it SHOULD NOT close the underlying
           protocol. Instead it SHOULD return its file descriptor. This is
           crucial for horizontal composability of protocols:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
      /* create stack of two protocols */
      h1 = foo_start();
      h2 = bar_start(h1);
      /* top protocol is closed but bottom one is still alive */
      h1 = bar_stop(h2);
      /* new top protocol is started */
      h3 = baz_start(h1);
      /* shut down both protocols */
      h1 = baz_stop(h3);
      foo_stop(h1);
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The protocol may live at the very bottom of the stack and have no
           underlying protocol. In that case the stop function returns 0 on
           success.</t>
        <t>In the case of error stop function MUST forcibly close the underying
           protocol (and thus recursively all protocols beneath it), return -1
           and set errno to the appropriate value.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Orderly termination with a handshake">
        <t>Protocols with terminal handshake SHOULD allow the user to take
           control of the process by implementing "done" function in addition to
           "stop" function. The former function should start the termination
           handshake with the peer and return to the user without waiting for
           the reply. After calling this function any attempt to send more
           data MUST result in EPIPE error.</t>
        <t>After calling done function the users can still receive data. When
           termination handshake is completed by the peer and all the pending
           data are received by the local peer recv function MUST return EPIPE
           error.</t>
        <t>Afterwards, stop function can be called to retrieve the underlying
           socket:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
      /* Send HTTP request. */
      t = tcp_connect("192.168.0.111:80");
      s = crlf_start(t);
      msend(s, "GET /foo HTTP/1.1", 17, -1);
      msend(s, "name1: value1", 13, -1);
      msend(s, "name2: value2", 13, -1);
      crlf_done(s, -1);
      /* Receive HTTP response. */
      while(1) {
          int rc = mrecv(s, buf, sizeof(buf), -1);
          if(rc &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; errno == EPIPE) break;
          ...
      }
      t = crlf_stop(s, -1);
      /* Switch to HTML here. */
      ...
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Stop function must work correctly irrespective of whether done
           function was called before or not. It must also work whether the user
           received all the inbound data or not.</t>
        <t>The implementation should therefore start termination handshake (if
           not done already), then read and discard incoming data until
           termination response from the peer is received. Finally, it should
           deallocate the socket and return the underlying socket's file
           descriptor.</t>
        <t>Note that this design does away with BSD socket SO_LINGER behaviour
           which cannot be cleanly implemented in user space.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Conflating handshakes">
      <t>With many protocols layered one on top of another the latency
         introduced by many initial and/or terminal handshakes may become
         prohibitive. For example, with 10-layered stack of protocols
         and RTT between peers at 100ms, the entire initiation sequence would
         take one second.</t>
      <t>To deal with this problem most protocols are not supposed to have
         initial or terminal handshake of their own. Instead, all parameters
         the would be otherwise negotiated with the peer are passed as arguments
         to the start function. The stop function, on the other hand, just
         flushes any unsent data and returns the underlying socket.</t>
      <t>Note that this is exactly how unconnected protocols work. There is
         no difference between "unconnected sockets" and "sockets with
         a conflated handshake".</t>
      <t>The unconnected protocol should then live on top of the connected
         protocol. Parameter negotiation is performed before the top protocol
         is initialized:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
    int tcps = tcp_connect("192.168.0.111:80");
    /* Websockets is a connected protocol. */
    int ws = websock_connect(tcps);
    uint16_t compression_algoritm;
    mrecv(ws, &amp;compression_algorithm, 2, -1);
    /* Compression socket is unconnected. */
    int cs = compress_start(ws, compression_algorithm);
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>When one of the peers decides to close the connection it stops the
         unconnected protocol on top. That flushes any unsent data to the
         underlying protocol. Then it stops the connected protocol on the bottom
         which performs the final handshake:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
    int ws = compress_stop(cs, -1);
    int tcps = websock_stop(ws, -1);
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>On the side of the connection that haven't triggered the shutdown
         the code looks very much the same, except that it is triggered by
         getting EPIPE error from a receive function.</t>
      <t>Important thing to note is that at this point both peers are in sync
         with respect to where the protocol ends. They can start a new protocol
         on top of the same TCP connection without having to deal with leftover
         data from previous communication.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Normal operation">
      <t>Everything that happens between protocol initialization and protocol
         termination will be referred to as "normal operation".</t>

      <section title = "Application protocols">
         <t>Application protocols live on top of transport protocols. Rather
            than passing raw data they are meant to perform a specific service
            for the user (e.g. DNS performs name lookups).</t>
         <t>Application protocols don't send or receive data. Therefore,
            they have no standardized API for normal operation. Still they
            can be initialized and terminated same way as other protocols.</t>
         <t>From the point of view of this document, application protocol is
            always at the topmost level of the protocol stack.</t>
      </section>

      <section title = "Presentation protocols">
         <t>Presentation protocols add structure to data carried by transport
            protocols (e.g. ASN.1, JSON, XML). This proposal doesn't address
            them in any way. Either the protocol sends/receives binary data
            that just happen to be in a structured format in which case it's
            a standard transport protocol. Or the protocol exposes special API
            to browse the structured data in which case it is an application
            protocol.</t>
      </section>

      <section title = "Transport protocols">
         <t>The term "transport protocol" in this memo has broader scope than
            "OSI L4 protocol". By "transport protocol" we mean anything capable
            of sending and/or receiving unstructured data, be it TCP, IP or
            Ethernet.</t>

        <section title="Bytestream protocols">
          <t>Byte stream protocols are transport protocols that define no
             message boundaries. One peer can send 10 bytes, then 8 bytes. The
             peer can read all 18 bytes at once or read first 12 bytes,
             then 6 bytes. Bytestream protocols are always reliable (no bytes
             can be lost) and ordered (bytes are received in the same order they
             were sent in). TCP is a classic example of bytestream protocol.</t>
          <t>Bytestream protocols can be used via following four functions:</t>
          <figure>
            <artwork>
    int bsend(int h, const void *buf, size_t len,
        int64_t deadline);
    int brecv(int h, void *buf, size_t len,
        int64_t deadline);
    int bsendv(int h, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
        int64_t deadline);
    int brecvv(int h, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
        int64_t deadline);
            </artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>Function bsend() sends data to the protocol. The protocol SHOULD
             send them, after whatever manipulation is required, to its
             underlying protocol. Eventually, the lowermost protocol in the
             stack sends the data to the network.</t>
          <t>Function brecv() reads data from the protocol. The protocol SHOULD
             read them from the underlying socket and after whetever
             manipulation is needed return them to the caller. The lowermost
             protocol in the stack reads the data from the network.</t>
          <t>All the functions MUST be blocking and exhibit atomic behaviour.
             I.e. either all data are sent/received or none of them are. In the
             later case protocol MUST be marked as broken, errno MUST be set to
             appropriate value and -1 MUST be returned to the user. Any
             subsequent attempt to use the protocol MUST result in an error.</t>
          <t>Expired deadline is considered to be an error and the protocol
             MUST behave as described above setting errno to ETIMEDOUT.</t>
          <t>In case of success both functions MUST return zero.</t>
          <t>Note that the implementation of brecv() may change the content
             of the buffer even in case of error. However, what will be written
             into the buffer is unpredictable and using such data will result
             in undefined behaviour.</t>
          <t>Functions bsendv() and brecvv() MUST behave in the same way
             as bsend() and brecv(), the only difference being that buffers are
             passed to the functions via scatter/gather arrays, same way as in
             POSIX sendmsg() and recvmsg() functions.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Message protocols">
          <t>Message protocols are transport protocols that preserve message
             boundaries. While message protocols are not necessarily reliable
             (messages can be lost) or ordered (messages can be received in
             different order than they were sent in) they are always atomic.
             User will receive either complete message or no message. IP, UDP
             and WebSockets are examples of message protocols.</t>
          <t>Message protocols can be used via following four functions:</t>
          <figure>
            <artwork>
    int msend(int s, const void *buf, size_t len,
        int64_t deadline);
    ssize_t mrecv(int h, void *buf, size_t len,
        int64_t deadline);
    int msendv(int s, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
        int64_t deadline);
    ssize_t mrecvv(int s, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
        int64_t deadline);
            </artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>Function msend() sends message to the protocol. The protocol SHOULD
             send it, after whatever manipulation is required, to its
             underlying protocol. Eventually, the lowermost protocol in the
             stack sends the data to the network.</t>
          <t>Function mrecv() reads message from the protocol. The protocol
             SHOULD read it from its underlying protocol and after whetever
             manipulation is needed return it to the caller. The lowermost
             protocol in the stack reads the data from the network.</t>
          <t>All the functions MUST be blocking and exhibit atomic behaviour.
             I.e. either entire message is sent/received or none of it is. In
             the later case errno MUST be set to appropriate value and -1 MUST
             be returned to the user. The protocol MAY be marked as broken and
             any subsequent attempt to use it will result in an error.</t>
          <t>Note that unlike with bytestream sockets the buffer supplied to
             mrecv() doesn't have to be fully filled in, i.e. received messaged
             may be smaller than the buffer.</t>
          <t>If the message is larger than the buffer, it is considered to be an
             error and the protocol must behave as described above, setting
             errno to EMSGSIZE. If there's no way to discard the unread part of
             the message in constant time it SHOULD also mark the protocol as
             broken and refuse any further operations. This behaviour prevents
             DoS attack by sending very large messages.</t>
          <t>Expired deadline is considered to be an error and the protocol
             MUST behave as described above, setting errno to ETIMEDOUT.</t>
          <t>In case of success msend() function MUST return zero, mrecv()
             MUST return the size of the received message (zero is a valid
             size).</t>
          <t>The implementation of mrecv() may change the content of the buffer
             even in case of error. However, what will be written into the
             buffer is unpredictable and using such data will result
             in undefined behaviour.</t>
          <t>Functions msendv() and mrecvv() MUST behave in the same way
             as msend() and mrecv(). The only difference is that buffers are
             passed to the functions via scatter/gather arrays, same way as in
             POSIX sendmsg() and recvmsg() functions.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Custom sending and receiving">
          <t>In addition to send/recv functions described above,  protocols
             MAY implement its own custom send/recv functions. These
             functions should be called "send" and/or "recv" (e.g.
             "udp_send").</t>
          <t>Custom functions allow for providing additional arguments. For
             example, UDP protocol may implement custom send function with
             additional "destination IP address" argument.</t>
          <t>A protocol MAY also implement multiple send or receive functions
             as needed.</t>
          <t>Protocol implementors should try to make custom send/recv
             functions as consistent with msend/mrecv as possible.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Error codes">
          <t>Send and receive function may return following error codes:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>EBADF: Bad file descriptor.</t>
              <t>ECONNRESET: Connection broken. For example, a failure to
                 receive a keepalive from the peer may result in this error.</t>
              <t>EMSGSIZE: Message is too large to fit into the supplied buffer.
                 Only applies to mrecv() and mrecvv().</t>
              <t>ENOTSUP: The socket does not support the function. For example,
                 msend() was called on a bytestream socket.</t>
              <t>EPIPE: Connection was terminated in orderly fashion.</t>
              <t>EPROTO: The peer has violated the protocol specification.</t>
              <t>ETIMEDOUT: Deadline expired.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>Some of the error codes (EPIPE, ECONNRESET) are applicable only
             to connection-based protocols. They make no sense for unconnected
             protocols such as UDP. However, a protocol that is agnostic about
             whether it is connected or not may get these errors from the
             underlying connection-based protocol and pass them to the user.</t>
          <t>Connection-based protocols MAY treat some of the errors as
             unrecoverable. In these cases any subsequent operation on the
             socket MUST return same error.</t>
          <t>The implementation SHOULD NOT go into great lengths to implement
             recoverable errors. Instead, it should stick to the most natural
             semantics of the protocol. For example, ETIMEDOUT and EMSGSIZE
             may seem to be recoverable errors, however, the implementation
             would have to allocate memory to temporarily store the message
             which could in turn allow DoS attacks be sending large messages.
             It may thus be preferable to make these errors unrecoverable.</t>

    <section title="Examples">
      <t>To give an example of microprotocols that can be implemented using
         proposed API, here's the list of what's implemented in the
         proof-of-concept project:
        <list style="sybmols">
          <t>compressor: compresses messages</t>
          <t>crlf: takes a bytestream protocol and turns it into message
             protocol by delimiting message by CRLF sequences</t>
          <t>encryptor: encrypts and authenticates messages</t>
          <t>keepalive: sends a keepalive message once in a while, on receiving
             side it check whether keepalives are arriving</t>
          <t>log: logs all data to the console (used for debugging)</t>
          <t>nagle: batches outgoing data to improve performance</t>
          <t>pfx: turns a bytestream protocol into message-based protocol by
             prefixing each message by its size</t>
          <t>tcp: wraps system implementation of TCP protocol</t>
          <t>throttler: imposes a limit of amount of data that can be sent
             and/or recevied per second</t>
          <t>udp: wraps system implementation of UDP protocol</t>
          <t>unix: wraps system implementation of UNIX domain sockets</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>And here's an example of how the microprotocols can be combined to
         achieve complex functionality:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
    /* Create a TCP connection. */
    h1 = tcp_connect(addr, -1);
    /* Limits outgoing traffic to 1MB/sec. Check every 1000ms. */
    h2 = throttler_start(h1, 1024 * 1024, 1000, 0, 0);
    /* Batch up to 2000 bytes of outgoing traffic. */
    h3 = nagle_start(h2, 2000, 100);
    /* Convert bytes into messages. */
    h4 = pfx_start(h3);
    /* Send keepalives message every 1000ms. */
    h5 = keepalive_start(h4, 1000, 4000, "KEEPALIVE", 9);
    /* Encrypt and authenticate messages. */
    h6 = encrypt_start(h5, key, sizeof(key), -1);
    /* Compress the messages. */
    h7 = compress_start(h6);
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>Let's have a look at what happens to a message sent by the end user.
         It traverses the stack from level 7 to level 1. First it gets
         compressed, then it gets encrypted. Keepalive protocol doesn't modify
         the message but may interject keepalive messages. Then the message is
         transformed to a stream of bytes. In this case it's the size
         of the message in network byte order followed by the body
         of the message. Nagle protocol doesn't modify the data but it may
         delay it by at most 100ms and batch it with preceding and/or
         following data. Throttler once again doesn't modify the data but may
         delay so as not to violate the bandwidth limit. Finally, the data is
         sent to the network via TCP protocol.</t>
      <t>In the opposite direction, message traverses the stack from level 1 to
         level 7. Bytes are read from TCP protocol. Throttler doesn't have
         limit set for incoming data and thus the data are just silently
         passed through it. Nagle doesn't do anything with incoming data.
         Then, the bytes are parsed and converted into a message. Keepalive
         layer doesn't do anything with the message itself, but it checks
         whether there have been any messages in last 4 seconds and if not so
         it raises an error. Finally, message is decrypted and authenticated at
         level 6 and decompressed at level 7.</t>

    <section title="Unresolved issues">
      <t>This is a draft specification. It still contains some unresolved
         problems:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>End users prefer to create full protocol stacks using a single
             function. For example, they would like websock_start() to create
             a TCP connection and the WebSocket protocol on top of that.
             Protocol designers, on the other hand, would prefer to split the
             operation into two steps, so that they can layer WebSockets on
             top of any bytestream protocol. This can be solved by having two
             different protocols (TCP+WebSockets vs. stand-alone-WebSockets),
             but that is likely to cause naming clashing and confuse the users.
             </t> 
          <t>Conflated protocol handshakes don't play well with two-phase
             protocol shutdown (done+stop). "done" function on the underlying
             connected protocol cannot be invoked because the socket in question
             is still owned by the top level unconnected protocol.</t>
          <t>There are bandwidth optimizations that can be made in unconnected
             protocols if we knew that it's actually running on the top of a
             connected protocol. For example, unconnected encryption protocol
             may have to put a nonce to every message. However, if it knew it
             was being used on top of a reliable transport protocol, such as
             TPC, it could send the nonce once at the beginning of the
             connection and then increment it by one for every message.
             It is not clear whether such optimization is worth doing given that
             with bandwidth we are not facing any hard physical limits -- unlike
             with latency which is limited by the speed of light.</t>
