1.  Introduction

   The progress in the area of network protocols is distinctively
   lagging behind.  While every hobbyist new to the art of programming
   writes and publishes their small JavaScript libraries, there's no
   such thing going on with network protocols.  Indeed, it looks like
   the field of network protocols is dominated by big companies and
   academia, just like programming as a whole used to be before the
   advent of personal computers.

   While social and political reasons may be partly to blame (adoption,
   interoperability etc.) the technology itself creates a huge barrier
   to popular participation.  For example, the fact that huge part of
   the networking stack typically lives in the kernel space will prevent
   most people from even trying.  More importantly though there is
   basically no way to reuse what already exists.  While in JavaScript
   world you can get other people's libraries, quickly glue them
   together, add a bit of code of your own and publish a shiny new
   library, you can't do the same thing with network protocols.  You
   can't take framing from WebSockets, add multihoming from SCTP, keep-
   alives from TCP and congestion control from DCCP.  You have to write
   most of the code yourself which requires a lot of time, often more
   than a single hobbyist programmer can realistically afford.

   This memo proposes to fix the reusability problem by revamping the
   old BSD socket API and while doing so strongly focusing on
   composability of protocols.

   In short, the API proposed in this document doesn't try to virtualize
   all possible aspects of all possible protocols and provide a single
   set of functions to deal with all of them.  Instead, it acknowledges
   how varied the protocol landscape is and how much the requirements
   for individual protocols differ.  Therefore, it lets each protocol
   define its own API and asks only for bare minimum of standardised
   behaviour needed to implement protocol composability.

   As a consequence, the new API is much more leightweight and flexible
   than BSD socket API and allows to decompose today's monolithic
   protocol monsters into small single-purpose microprotocols that can
   be easily combined together to achieve desired functionality.

   The document also provides some non-binding suggestions for protocol
   API designers.  Following these suggestions would lead to uniform
   feel of the APIs and flat learning curve for protocol users.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  Composability

   To cover all the use cases the API has to support two distinct kinds
   of composabilty.

3.1.  Vertical composability

   Vertical composability is an ability to stack protocols one on the
   top of another.  From the network point of view the protocol on the
   top is a payload of the protocol on the bottom.  From the API point
   of view the top protocol encapsulates the bottom protocol, very much
   like a function encapsulates another function that it calls.

   Example of vertical stack of protocols:

                               +----------+
                               |   HTTP   |
                               +----------+
                               |    TCP   |
                               +----------+
                               |    IP    |
                               +----------+
                               | Ethernet |
                               +----------+

3.2.  Horizontal composability

   Horizontal composability is an ability to execute protocols in
   sequential manner.  From the network point of view one type of
   communication ends and is replaced by another type of communication.
   From API point of view one protocol is terminated and another one is
   started, reusing the same underlying protocol, very much like a
   function can call two nested functions in sequence without having to
   exit itself.

   An example of horizontal composability is how typical web page is
   trasferred by first doing HTTP handshake, followed by HTML body:

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp             October 2016


                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |   HTTP   |          HTML          |
                  +----------+------------------------+
                  |                TCP                |
                  +-----------------------------------+

   Note how this design makes protocol reusable: Same HTTP handshake can
   be used, for example, to initiate a WebSocket session.

   Another example of horizontal composability is how STARTTLS switches
   non-encrypted protocol into encrypted version of the same protocol.

   While these are very visible cases of composing protocols
   horizontally, the technique is in fact ubiquitous.  For example, most
   protocols are composed from three distinct mini-protocols: protocol
   header (initial handshake), protocol body (sending data back and
   forth) and protocol footer (terminal handshake):

                  +-----------------------------------+
                  | Header |       Body      | Footer |
                  +--------+-----------------+--------+
                  |                TCP                |
                  +-----------------------------------+

4.  Scheduling or rather lack of it

   During the decades since BSD sockets were first introduced the way
   they are used have changed significantly.  While in the beginning the
   user was supposed to fork a new process for each connection and do
   all the work using simple blocking calls nowadays they are expected
   to keep a pool of connections, check them via functions like poll()
   or kqueue() and dispatch any work to be done to one of the worker
   threads in a thread pool.  In other words, user is supposed to do
   both network and CPU scheduling.

   This change happened for performance reasons and haven't improved
   functionality or usability of BSD socket API in any way.  On the
   contrary, by requiring every programmer, however junior or
   uninterested in system design topics, to do system programmer's work
   it contributed to proliferation of buggy, hard-to-debug and barely
   maintainable code.

   To address this problem, this memo assumes that there already exists
   an efficient concurrency implementation where forking a new
   lightweight process takes at most hundreds of nanoseconds and context
   switch takes tens of nanoseconds.  Note that there are already such
   concurrency systems deployed in the wild.  One well-known example are
   Golang's goroutines but there are others available as well.

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp             October 2016


   In such environment network programming can be done in the old "one
   process per connection" way.  There's no need for polling, thread
   pools, callbacks, explicit state machines and so on.

   This memo thus adheres to "let system programmers do system
   programming" maxim and doesn't address the problem of scheduling, be
   it CPU scheduling or network scheduling, at all.

   As a footnote, it should be metioned that this proposal makes couple
   of deliberate design choices that prevent the modern "schedule by
   hand" style of network programming.

5.  File descriptors

   One of the design goals of this API is to support both kernel space
   and user space implementations.  One problem with that is that kernel
   space objects are typically reffered to by file descriptors while, at
   the same time, there's no easy way to associate user space objects
   with file descriptors.

   Therefore this specification allows user space implementations to use
   fake file descriptors (simple integers that kernel space knows
   nothing about) and does not guarantee that system functions will work
   with those descriptors.

   For example, you cannot count on POSIX close() function to be able to
   close a socket.  Therefore, hclose() function is introduced which
   maps directly to close() in kernel-space implementations but can be
   overriden by custom implementation in a user-space implementation.

6.  Socket options

   There's no equivalent to socket options as they are known from BSD
   socket API.  Any such functionality is supposed to be built by
   vertical layering of protocols.

7.  Deadlines

   Unlike with BSD sockets the deadlines are points in time rather than
   intervals.  This allows to use the same deadline in multiple calls
   without need for recomputing the remaining interval:

       int64_t deadline = now() + 1000;
       bsend(h, "ABC", 3, deadline);
       bsend(h, "DEF", 3, deadline);

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp             October 2016


8.  Function prototypes

   For consistency's sake the function names SHOULD be in lowercase and
   SHOULD be composed of short protocol name and action name separated
   by underscore (e.g. "tcp_connect").  Of course, in non-C languages
   the native naming convention should be followed, but even then the
   name SHOULD contain both protocol name and action name.

   First argument of the function, where applicable, SHOULD be the file
   descriptor.

   In all blocking functions the last argument SHOULD be the deadline.

9.  Protocol initialization

   A protocol SHOULD be initialized using "start" function (e.g.
   "smtp_start").  If protocol runs on top of another protocol the file
   descriptor of the underlying protocol SHOULD be supplied as the first
   argument of the function.  The function may have arbitrary number of
   additional arguments.

   The function SHOULD return the file descriptor of the newly created
   protocol instance.  In case of error it SHOULD return -1 and set
   errno to the appropriate error.

   Some protocols require more complex setup.  Consider TCP's
   listen/connect/accept connection setup process.  These protocols
   should use custom set of functions rather than try to shoehorn all
   the functionality into one all-purpose "start" function.

   If protocol runs on top of an underlying protocol it takes ownership
   of that protocol.  Using the low level protocol while it is owned by
   a higher level protocol will result in undefined behaviour.

   Example of creating a stack of four protocols:

       int s1 = tcp_connect("192.168.0.111:5555");
       int s2 = foo_start(s1, arg1, arg2, arg3);
       int s3 = bar_start(s2);
       int s4 = baz_start(s3, arg4, arg5);

10.  Protocol termination

10.1.  Forceful termination

   Protocol descriptor is closed by hclose() function.  In kernel-space
   implementations this function maps to standard POSIX close().  The
   protocol MUST shut down immediately without trying to do termination



Sustrik                  Expires April 26, 2017                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp             October 2016


   handshake or similar.  Note that this is different from how BSD
   sockets behave.

   The protocol MUST also clean up all resources it owns including
   closing the underlying protocol.  Given that the underlying protocol
   does the same operation, an entire stack of protocols can be shut
   down recursivelly by closing the file descriptor of the topmost
   protocol:

         int h1 = foo_start();
         int h2 = bar_start(h1);
         int h3 = baz_start(h2);
         hclose(h3); /* baz, bar and foo are shut down */

10.2.  Orderly termination without a handshake

   To perform an orderly shut down there SHOULD be a protocol-specific
   function called "stop".  In addition to the file descriptor the
   function can have arbitrary number of other arguments.

   The function MUST flush any unsent data.

   If the shut down functionality is potentially blocking the last
   argument SHOULD be a deadline.

   If stop function succeeds it SHOULD NOT close the underlying
   protocol.  Instead it SHOULD return its file descriptor.  This is
   crucial for horizontal composability of protocols:

         /* create stack of two protocols */
         h1 = foo_start();
         h2 = bar_start(h1);
         /* top protocol is closed but bottom one is still alive */
         h1 = bar_stop(h2);
         /* new top protocol is started */
         h3 = baz_start(h1);
         /* shut down both protocols */
         h1 = baz_stop(h3);
         foo_stop(h1);

   The protocol may live at the very bottom of the stack and have no
   underlying protocol.  In that case the stop function returns 0 on
   success.

   In the case of error stop function MUST forcibly close the underying
   protocol (and thus recursively all protocols beneath it), return -1
   and set errno to the appropriate value.

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp             October 2016


10.3.  Orderly termination with a handshake

   Protocols with terminal handshake SHOULD allow the user to take
   control of the process by implementing "done" function in addition to
   "stop" function.  The former function should start the termination
   handshake with the peer and return to the user without waiting for
   the reply.  After calling this function any attempt to send more data
   MUST result in EPIPE error.

   After calling done function the users can still receive data.  When
   termination handshake is completed by the peer and all the pending
   data are received by the local peer recv function MUST return EPIPE
   error.

   Afterwards, stop function can be called to retrieve the underlying
   socket:

         /* Send HTTP request. */
         t = tcp_connect("192.168.0.111:80");
         s = crlf_start(t);
         msend(s, "GET /foo HTTP/1.1", 17, -1);
         msend(s, "name1: value1", 13, -1);
         msend(s, "name2: value2", 13, -1);
         crlf_done(s, -1);
         /* Receive HTTP response. */
         while(1) {
             int rc = mrecv(s, buf, sizeof(buf), -1);
             if(rc < 0 && errno == EPIPE) break;
             ...
         }
         t = crlf_stop(s, -1);
         /* Switch to HTML here. */
         ...

   Stop function must work correctly irrespective of whether done
   function was called before or not.  It must also work whether the
   user received all the inbound data or not.

   The implementation should therefore start termination handshake (if
   not done already), then read and discard incoming data until
   termination response from the peer is received.  Finally, it should
   deallocate the socket and return the underlying socket's file
   descriptor.

   Note that this design does away with BSD socket SO_LINGER behaviour
   which cannot be cleanly implemented in user space.

11.  Conflating handshakes

   With many protocols layered one on top of another the latency
   introduced by many initial and/or terminal handshakes may become
   prohibitive.  For example, with 10-layered stack of protocols and RTT
   between peers at 100ms, the entire initiation sequence would take one
   second.

   TODO

12.  Normal operation

   Everything that happens between protocol initialization and protocol
   termination will be referred to as "normal operation".

12.1.  Application protocols

   Application protocols live on top of transport protocols.  Rather
   than passing raw data they are meant to perform a specific service
   for the user (e.g.  DNS performs name lookups).

   Application protocols don't send or receive data.  Therefore, they
   have no standardized API for normal operation.  Still they can be
   initialized and terminated same way as other protocols.

   From the point of view of this document, application protocol is
   always at the topmost level of the protocol stack.

12.2.  Presentation protocols

   Presentation protocols add structure to data carried by transport
   protocols (e.g.  ASN.1, JSON, XML).  This proposal doesn't address
   them in any way.  Either the protocol sends/receives binary data that
   just happen to be in a structured format in which case it's a
   standard transport protocol.  Or the protocol exposes special API to
   browse the structured data in which case it is an application
   protocol.

12.3.  Transport protocols

   The term "transport protocol" in this memo has broader scope than
   "OSI L4 protocol".  By "transport protocol" we mean anything capable
   of sending and/or receiving unstructured data, be it TCP, IP or
   Ethernet.

12.3.1.  Bytestream protocols

   Byte stream protocols are transport protocols that define no message
   boundaries.  One peer can send 10 bytes, then 8 bytes.  The peer can
   read all 18 bytes at once or read first 12 bytes, then 6 bytes.
   Bytestream protocols are always reliable (no bytes can be lost) and
   ordered (bytes are received in the same order they were sent in).
   TCP is a classic example of bytestream protocol.

   Bytestream protocols can be used via following four functions:

       int bsend(int h, const void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       int brecv(int h, void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       int bsendv(int h, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);
       int brecvv(int h, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);

   Function bsend() sends data to the protocol.  The protocol SHOULD
   send them, after whatever manipulation is required, to its underlying
   protocol.  Eventually, the lowermost protocol in the stack sends the
   data to the network.

   Function brecv() reads data from the protocol.  The protocol SHOULD
   read them from the underlying socket and after whetever manipulation
   is needed return them to the caller.  The lowermost protocol in the
   stack reads the data from the network.

   All the functions MUST be blocking and exhibit atomic behaviour.
   I.e. either all data are sent/received or none of them are.  In the
   later case protocol MUST be marked as broken, errno MUST be set to
   appropriate value and -1 MUST be returned to the user.  Any
   subsequent attempt to use the protocol MUST result in an error.

   Expired deadline is considered to be an error and the protocol MUST
   behave as described above setting errno to ETIMEDOUT.

   In case of success both functions MUST return zero.

   Note that the implementation of brecv() may change the content of the
   buffer even in case of error.  However, what will be written into the
   buffer is unpredictable and using such data will result in undefined
   behaviour.

   Functions bsendv() and brecvv() MUST behave in the same way as
   bsend() and brecv(), the only difference being that buffers are

   passed to the functions via scatter/gather arrays, same way as in
   POSIX sendmsg() and recvmsg() functions.

12.3.2.  Message protocols

   Message protocols are transport protocols that preserve message
   boundaries.  While message protocols are not necessarily reliable
   (messages can be lost) or ordered (messages can be received in
   different order than they were sent in) they are always atomic.  User
   will receive either complete message or no message.  IP, UDP and
   WebSockets are examples of message protocols.

   Message protocols can be used via following four functions:

       int msend(int s, const void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       ssize_t mrecv(int h, void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       int msendv(int s, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);
       ssize_t mrecvv(int s, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);

   Function msend() sends message to the protocol.  The protocol SHOULD
   send it, after whatever manipulation is required, to its underlying
   protocol.  Eventually, the lowermost protocol in the stack sends the
   data to the network.

   Function mrecv() reads message from the protocol.  The protocol
   SHOULD read it from its underlying protocol and after whetever
   manipulation is needed return it to the caller.  The lowermost
   protocol in the stack reads the data from the network.

   All the functions MUST be blocking and exhibit atomic behaviour.
   I.e. either entire message is sent/received or none of it is.  In the
   later case errno MUST be set to appropriate value and -1 MUST be
   returned to the user.  The protocol MAY be marked as broken and any
   subsequent attempt to use it will result in an error.

   Note that unlike with bytestream sockets the buffer supplied to
   mrecv() doesn't have to be fully filled in, i.e. received messaged
   may be smaller than the buffer.

   If the message is larger than the buffer, it is considered to be an
   error and the protocol must behave as described above, setting errno
   to EMSGSIZE.  If there's no way to discard the unread part of the
   message in constant time it SHOULD also mark the protocol as broken

   and refuse any further operations.  This behaviour prevents DoS
   attack by sending very large messages.

   Expired deadline is considered to be an error and the protocol MUST
   behave as described above, setting errno to ETIMEDOUT.

   In case of success msend() function MUST return zero, mrecv() MUST
   return the size of the received message (zero is a valid size).

   The implementation of mrecv() may change the content of the buffer
   even in case of error.  However, what will be written into the buffer
   is unpredictable and using such data will result in undefined
   behaviour.

   Functions msendv() and mrecvv() MUST behave in the same way as
   msend() and mrecv().  The only difference is that buffers are passed
   to the functions via scatter/gather arrays, same way as in POSIX
   sendmsg() and recvmsg() functions.

12.3.3.  Custom sending and receiving

   In addition to send/recv functions described above, protocols MAY
   implement its own custom send/recv functions.  These functions should
   be called "send" and/or "recv" (e.g.  "udp_send").

   Custom functions allow for providing additional arguments.  For
   example, UDP protocol may implement custom send function with
   additional "destination IP address" argument.

   A protocol MAY also implement multiple send or receive functions as
   needed.

   Protocol implementors should try to make custom send/recv functions
   as consistent with msend/mrecv as possible.

12.3.4.  Error codes

   Send and receive function may return following error codes:

   o  EBADF: Bad file descriptor.

   o  ECONNRESET: Connection broken.  For example, a failure to receive
      a keepalive from the peer may result in this error.

   o  EMSGSIZE: Message is too large to fit into the supplied buffer.
      Only applies to mrecv() and mrecvv().

   o  ENOTSUP: The socket does not support the function.  For example,
      msend() was called on a bytestream socket.

   o  EPIPE: Connection was terminated in orderly fashion.

   o  EPROTO: The peer has violated the protocol specification.

   o  ETIMEDOUT: Deadline expired.

   Some of the error codes (EPIPE, ECONNRESET) are applicable only to
   connection-based protocols.  They make no sense for unconnected
   protocols such as UDP.  However, a protocol that is agnostic about
   whether it is connected or not may get these errors from the
   underlying connection-based protocol and pass them to the user.

   Connection-based protocols MAY treat some of the errors as
   unrecoverable.  In these cases any subsequent operation on the socket
   MUST return same error.

   The implementation SHOULD NOT go into great lengths to implement
   recoverable errors.  Instead, it should stick to the most natural
   semantics of the protocol.  For example, ETIMEDOUT and EMSGSIZE may
   seem to be recoverable errors, however, the implementation would have
   to allocate memory to temporarily store the message which could in
   turn allow DoS attacks be sending large messages.  It may thus be
   preferable to make these errors unrecoverable.

13.  Examples

   To give an example of microprotocols that can be implemented using
   proposed API, here's the list of what's implemented in the proof-of-
   concept project:

      compressor: compresses messages

      crlf: takes a bytestream protocol and turns it into message
      protocol by delimiting message by CRLF sequences

      encryptor: encrypts and authenticates messages

      keepalive: sends a keepalive message once in a while, on receiving
      side it check whether keepalives are arriving

      log: logs all data to the console (used for debugging)

      nagle: batches outgoing data to improve performance

      pfx: turns a bytestream protocol into message-based protocol by
      prefixing each message by its size

      tcp: wraps system implementation of TCP protocol

      throttler: imposes a limit of amount of data that can be sent and/
      or recevied per second

      udp: wraps system implementation of UDP protocol

      unix: wraps system implementation of UNIX domain sockets

   And here's an example of how the microprotocols can be combined to
   achieve complex functionality:

       /* Create a TCP connection. */
       h1 = tcp_connect(addr, -1);
       /* Limits outgoing traffic to 1MB/sec. Check every 1000ms. */
       h2 = throttler_start(h1, 1024 * 1024, 1000, 0, 0);
       /* Batch up to 2000 bytes of outgoing traffic. */
       h3 = nagle_start(h2, 2000, 100);
       /* Convert bytes into messages. */
       h4 = pfx_start(h3);
       /* Send keepalives message every 1000ms. */
       h5 = keepalive_start(h4, 1000, 4000, "KEEPALIVE", 9);
       /* Encrypt and authenticate messages. */
       h6 = encrypt_start(h5, key, sizeof(key), -1);
       /* Compress the messages. */
       h7 = compress_start(h6);

   Let's have a look at what happens to a message sent by the end user.
   It traverses the stack from level 7 to level 1.  First it gets
   compressed, then it gets encrypted.  Keepalive protocol doesn't
   modify the message but may interject keepalive messages.  Then the
   message is transformed to a stream of bytes.  In this case it's the
   size of the message in network byte order followed by the body of the
   message.  Nagle protocol doesn't modify the data but it may delay it
   by at most 100ms and batch it with preceding and/or following data.
   Throttler once again doesn't modify the data but may delay so as not
   to violate the bandwidth limit.  Finally, the data is sent to the
   network via TCP protocol.

   In the opposite direction, message traverses the stack from level 1
   to level 7.  Bytes are read from TCP protocol.  Throttler doesn't
   have limit set for incoming data and thus the data are just silently
   passed through it.  Nagle doesn't do anything with incoming data.
   Then, the bytes are parsed and converted into a message.  Keepalive
   layer doesn't do anything with the message itself, but it checks

   whether there have been any messages in last 4 seconds and if not so
   it raises an error.  Finally, message is decrypted and authenticated
   at level 6 and decompressed at level 7.

14.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

15.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of the new API don't differ from security
   implications of classic BSD socket API.  Still, it may be worth
   passing the design through a security audit.
