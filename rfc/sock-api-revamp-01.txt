1.  Introduction

   The progress in the area of network protocols is distinctively
   lagging behind.  While every hobbyist new to the art of programming
   writes and publishes their small JavaScript libraries, there's no
   such thing going on with network protocols.  Indeed, it looks like
   the field of network protocols is dominated by big companies and
   academia, just like programming as a whole used to be before the
   advent of personal computers.

   While social and political reasons may be partly to blame (adoption,
   interoperability etc.) the technology itself creates a huge barrier
   to popular participation.  For example, the fact that huge part of
   the networking stack typically lives in the kernel space will prevent
   most people from even trying.  More importantly though there is
   basically no way to reuse what already exists.  While in JavaScript
   world you can get other people's libraries, quickly glue them
   together, add a bit of code of your own and publish a shiny new
   library, you can't do the same thing with network protocols.  You
   can't take framing from WebSockets, add multihoming from SCTP, keep-
   alives from TCP and congestion control from DCCP.  You have to write
   most of the code yourself which requires a lot of time, often more
   than a single hobbyist programmer can realistically afford.

   This memo proposes to fix the reusability problem by revamping the
   old BSD socket API and while doing so strongly focusing on
   composability of protocols.

   In short, the API proposed in this document doesn't try to virtualize
   all possible aspects of all possible protocols and provide a single
   set of functions to deal with all of them.  Instead, it acknowledges
   how varied the protocol landscape is and how much the requirements
   for individual protocols differ.  Therefore, it lets each protocol
   define its own API and asks only for bare minimum of standardised
   behaviour needed to implement protocol composability.

   As a consequence, the new API is much more leightweight and flexible
   than classic BSD socket API and allows to decompose today's
   monolithic protocol monsters into small single-purpose microprotocols
   that can be easily combined together to achieve desired
   functionality.

   The document also provides some non-binding suggestions for protocol
   API designers.  Following these suggestions would lead to uniform
   feel of the APIs and flat learning curve for protocol users.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  Composability

   To cover all the use cases the API has to support two distinct kinds
   of composabilty.

3.1.  Vertical composability

   Vertical composability is an ability to stack protocols one on the
   top of another.  From the network point of view the protocol on the
   top is a payload of the protocol on the bottom.  From the API point
   of view the top protocol encapsulates the bottom protocol, very much
   like a function encapsulates another function that it calls.

   Example of vertical stack of protocols:

                               +----------+
                               |   HTTP   |
                               +----------+
                               |    TCP   |
                               +----------+
                               |    IP    |
                               +----------+
                               | Ethernet |
                               +----------+

3.2.  Horizontal composability

   Horizontal composability is an ability to execute protocols in
   sequential manner.  From the network point of view one type of
   communication ends and is replaced by another type of communication.
   From API point of view one protocol is terminated and another one is
   started, reusing the same underlying protocol, very much like a
   function can call two child functions in sequence without having to
   exit itself.

   An example of horizontal composability is how typical web page is
   trasferred by first doing HTTP handshake, followed by HTML body:

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


                  +-----------------------------------+
                  |   HTTP   |          HTML          |
                  +----------+------------------------+
                  |                TCP                |
                  +-----------------------------------+

   Note how this design makes protocol reusable: The same HTTP handshake
   can be used, for example, to initiate a WebSocket session.

   Another example of horizontal composability is how STARTTLS switches
   non-encrypted protocol into encrypted version of the same protocol.

   While these are very visible cases of composing protocols
   horizontally, the technique is in fact ubiquitous.  For example, most
   protocols are composed from three distinct mini-protocols: protocol
   header (initial handshake), protocol body (sending data back and
   forth) and protocol footer (terminal handshake):

                  +-----------------------------------+
                  | Header |       Body      | Footer |
                  +--------+-----------------+--------+
                  |                TCP                |
                  +-----------------------------------+

4.  Scheduling or rather lack of it

   During the decades since BSD sockets were first introduced the way
   they are used have changed significantly.  While in the beginning the
   user was supposed to fork a new process for each connection and do
   all the work using simple blocking calls nowadays they are expected
   to keep a pool of connections, check them via functions like poll()
   or kqueue() and dispatch any work to be done to one of the worker
   threads in a thread pool.  In other words, user is supposed to do
   both network and CPU scheduling.

   This change happened for performance reasons and haven't improved
   functionality or usability of BSD socket API in any way.  On the
   contrary, by requiring every programmer to do system programmer's
   work it contributed to proliferation of buggy, hard-to-debug and
   barely maintainable network code.

   To address this problem, this memo assumes that there already exists
   an efficient concurrency implementation where forking a new
   lightweight process takes at most hundreds of nanoseconds and context
   switch takes tens of nanoseconds.  Note that there are already such
   concurrency systems deployed in the wild.  One well-known example are
   Golang's goroutines but there are others available as well.

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


   In such environment network programming can be done in the old "one
   process per connection" way.  There's no need for polling, thread
   pools, callbacks, explicit state machines or similar.

   This memo thus adheres to "let system programmers do system
   programming" maxim and doesn't address the problem of scheduling, be
   it CPU scheduling or network scheduling, at all.

   As a footnote, it should be metioned that this proposal makes couple
   of deliberate design choices that prevent the modern "schedule by
   hand" style of network programming.

5.  File descriptors

   One of the design goals of this API is to support both kernel space
   and user space implementations.  One problem with that is that kernel
   space objects are typically reffered to by file descriptors while
   there is no easy way to associate user space objects with file
   descriptors.

   Therefore this specification allows user space implementations to use
   fake file descriptors (simple integers that kernel space knows
   nothing about) and does not guarantee that system functions will work
   with those descriptors.

   For example, you cannot count on POSIX close() function to be able to
   close a socket.  Therefore, hclose() function is introduced which
   maps directly to close() in kernel-space implementations but can be
   overriden by custom implementation in a user-space implementation.

6.  Socket options

   There's no equivalent to socket options as they are known from BSD
   socket API.  Any such functionality is supposed to be built by
   vertical layering of protocols.

7.  Deadlines

   Unlike with BSD sockets the deadlines are points in time rather than
   intervals.  This allows to use the same deadline in multiple calls
   without need for recomputing the remaining interval:

       int64_t deadline = now() + 1000;
       bsend(h, "ABC", 3, deadline);
       bsend(h, "DEF", 3, deadline);

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


8.  Function prototype conventions

   For consistency's sake the function names SHOULD be in lowercase and
   SHOULD be composed of short protocol name and action name separated
   by underscore (e.g. "tcp_connect").  Of course, in non-C languages
   the native naming convention should be followed, but even then the
   name SHOULD contain both protocol name and action name.

   Given that end users prefer to create full protocol stack using a
   single function it is desirable to have shrinkwrapped protocols
   aggregating many microprotocols into a coherent whole.  For example,
   "websock" protocol may be composed of TCP protocol and WebSocket
   protocol itself.  Still, expert users may want to have access to
   WebSocket protocol as such, without the underlying TCP protocol, say,
   if they want to run it on top of SCTP or any other alternative
   transport.  In such cases there is a naming dillema: Should "websock"
   name refer to TCP+WebSocket aggregate or to WebSocket alone?  In
   these cases the implemetors SHOULD always prefer the former solution.

   First argument of the function, where applicable, SHOULD be the file
   descriptor.

   In all blocking functions the last argument SHOULD be the deadline.

9.  Protocol initialization

   A protocol SHOULD be initialized using "start" function (e.g.
   "smtp_start").  If protocol runs on top of another protocol the file
   descriptor of the underlying protocol SHOULD be supplied as the first
   argument of the function.  The function MAY have arbitrary number of
   additional arguments.

   The function SHOULD return the file descriptor of the newly created
   protocol instance.  In case of error it SHOULD close the underlying
   protocol, return -1 and set errno to the appropriate error.

   Some protocols require more complex setup.  Consider TCP's
   listen/connect/accept connection setup process.  These protocols
   should use custom set of functions rather than try to shoehorn all
   the functionality into one all-purpose "start" function.

   If protocol runs on top of an underlying protocol it takes ownership
   of that protocol.  Using the low level protocol while it is owned by
   a higher level protocol will result in undefined behaviour.  A sane
   way to implement this behaviour is to create a duplicate of the
   underlying file descriptor to be owned by the parent protocol and
   closing the original file descriptor.  That way, user accidentally

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


   using a lower level protocol after it have been wrapped in higher
   layer protocol results in EBADF error.

   Example of creating a stack of four protocols:

       int s1 = tcp_connect("192.168.0.111:5555", -1);
       int s2 = foo_start(s1, arg1, arg2, arg3);
       int s3 = bar_start(s2);
       int s4 = baz_start(s3, arg4, arg5);

10.  Protocol termination

10.1.  Forceful termination

   Protocol descriptor is closed by hclose() function.  In kernel-space
   implementations this function maps directly to standard POSIX close()
   function.  The protocol MUST shut down immediately without trying to
   do termination handshake or similar.  Note that this is different
   from how BSD sockets behave.

   The protocol MUST also clean up all resources it owns including
   closing the underlying protocol.  Given that the underlying protocol
   does the same operation, an entire stack of protocols can be shut
   down recursivelly by closing the file descriptor of the topmost
   protocol:

         int h1 = foo_start();
         int h2 = bar_start(h1);
         int h3 = baz_start(h2);
         hclose(h3); /* baz, bar and foo are shut down */

10.2.  Orderly termination

   To perform an orderly shut down there SHOULD be a protocol-specific
   function called "stop".  In addition to the file descriptor the
   function can have arbitrary number of other arguments (for example a
   shutdown reason string to be sent to the peer).

   The function MUST flush any unsent data.

   If the shut down functionality is potentially blocking the last
   argument SHOULD be a deadline.

   If stop function succeeds it SHOULD NOT close the underlying
   protocol.  Instead it SHOULD return its file descriptor.  This is
   crucial for horizontal composability of protocols:

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


         /* create stack of two protocols */
         h1 = foo_start();
         h2 = bar_start(h1);
         /* top protocol is closed but bottom one is still alive */
         h1 = bar_stop(h2, -1);
         /* new top protocol is started */
         h3 = baz_start(h1);
         /* shut down both protocols */
         h1 = baz_stop(h3, -1);
         foo_stop(h1, -1);

   The protocol may live at the very bottom of the stack and have no
   underlying protocol.  In that case the stop function SHOULD return 0
   on success.

   In the case of error stop function MUST forcibly close the underying
   protocol (and thus recursively all protocols beneath it), return -1
   and set errno to the appropriate value.

   On the conceptual level, successfull invocation of "stop" function
   means that both local and remote endpoints agree that the protocol is
   finished and guarantee that no leftover data from the protocol will
   be delivered in the future.

   Note that this design does away with BSD socket SO_LINGER behaviour,
   which is problematic as it cannot be implemented cleanly in user
   space.

10.3.  Conflating handshakes

   With many protocols layered one on top of another the latency
   introduced by many initial handshakes may become prohibitive.  For
   example, with 10-layered stack of protocols and RTT between peers at
   100ms, the entire initiation sequence would take one second.

   To deal with this problem most protocols are not supposed to have
   initial or terminal handshake of their own.  Instead, all parameters
   that would otherwise be negotiated with the peer are passed as
   arguments to the start function.  The stop function, on the other
   hand, doesnt't do any handshakes just flushes any unsent data and
   returns the underlying socket.

   Note that this is exactly how unconnected protocols (e.g.  UDP) work.
   There is no difference between "unconnected sockets" and "sockets
   with a delegated handshake".

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


   The unconnected protocol lives on top of a connected protocol.
   Parameter negotiation is performed via the underlying connected
   protocol:

       /* Open underlying TCP connection. */
       int tcp = tcp_connect("192.168.0.111:5555", -1);
       /* Perform initial handshake via TCP. */
       int foo = 1, bar, baz, quux;
       bsend(tcp, &foo, sizeof(foo), -1);
       brecv(tcp, &bar, sizeof(bar), -1);
       brecv(tcp, &baz, sizeof(baz), -1);
       brecv(tcp, &quux, sizeof(quux), -1);
       /* Use the values from the handshake to initialize any number of
          protocols on top of the TCP connection. */
       int p1 = myprotocol1_start(tcp, bar);
       int p2 = myprotocol2_start(p1, baz, quux);

   When one of the peers decides to close the connection it stops the
   unconnected protocol on top.  That flushes any unsent data to the
   underlying protocol.  Then it stops the connected protocol on the
   bottom which performs the final handshake:

       int tcp = myprotocol_stop(s, -1);
       tcp_stop(tcp, -1);

   On the side of the connection that haven't triggered the shutdown the
   code looks very much the same, except that the functionality is
   triggered by getting EPIPE error from a receive function.

   Important thing to note is that at this point both peers are in sync
   with respect to where the protocol ends.  They can start a new
   protocol on top of the same TCP connection without having to deal
   with leftover data from previous communication.

10.4.  Half-closing a protocol

   Sometimes, endpoint wants to terminate a protocol, yet it still wants
   to receive any data sent by the peer prior to the termination.  The
   scenario gets tricky when combined with conflated handshakes: User
   has to stop the protocol on top to be able to start the termination
   handshake on the underlying protocol.  But having stopped the
   protocol on top in cannot receive any pending messages sent via that
   protocol.

   To address this use case, protocols SHOULD support "done" function,
   roughly equivalent to POSIX shutdown(SHUT_WR) function.

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


   The function MUST flush any pending outbound data and, if applicable,
   start the termination handshake.

   In case of success it returns the file descriptor of the underlying
   protocol, if any.  If there's no underlying protocol it returns zero.
   In either case, it MUST NOT close the socket.

   In case of error it MUST forcefully close the socket, return -1 and
   set errno to the appropriate value.

   After invoking "done" function, any sending-related functions on the
   socket MUST fail with EPIPE error.

   Using the file descriptor returned by "done" function for receiving
   data results in undefined behaviour.

   After calling done function the users can still receive data.  When
   termination handshake is completed by the peer and all the pending
   data are received by the local peer recv function MUST return EPIPE
   error.

   Afterwards, stop function can be called to close the socket.

       /* Start the termination handshake. */
       int tcp = myprotocol_done(s, -1);
       tcp_done(tcp, -1);
       /* Receive any pending messages. */
       while(1) {
           char buf[256];
           int rc = mrecv(s, buf, sizeof(buf), -1);
           if(rc == -1 && errno == EPIPE) break;
           ...
       }
       /* Close the socket. */
       tcp = myprotocol_stop(s, -1);
       tcp_stop(tcp, -1);

   "Stop" function MUST work correctly irrespective of whether "done"
   function was called before or not.  It MUST also work whether the
   user received all the inbound data or not.

   The implementation of "stop" should therefore start termination
   handshake (if not done already by "done" function), then read and
   discard incoming data until the peer finishes the termination
   handshake.  Finally, it MUST deallocate the socket and return the
   underlying socket's file descriptor.

11.  Normal operation

   Everything that happens between protocol initialization and protocol
   termination will be referred to as "normal operation".

11.1.  Application protocols

   Application protocols live on top of transport protocols.  Rather
   than passing raw data they are meant to perform a specific service
   for the user (e.g.  DNS performs name lookups).

   Application protocols don't send or receive data.  Therefore, they
   have no standardized API for normal operation.  Still they can be
   initialized and terminated same way as other protocols.

   From the point of view of this document, application protocol is
   always at the topmost level of the protocol stack.

11.2.  Presentation protocols

   Presentation protocols add structure to data carried by transport
   protocols (e.g.  ASN.1, JSON, XML).  This proposal doesn't address
   them in any way.  Either the protocol sends and receives binary data
   that just happen to be in a structured format in which case it's a
   standard transport protocol.  Or the protocol exposes special API to
   browse the structured data in which case it should be treated as an
   application protocol.

11.3.  Transport protocols

   The term "transport protocol" in this memo has broader scope than
   "OSI L4 protocol".  By "transport protocol" we mean anything capable
   of sending and/or receiving unstructured data, be it TCP, IP or
   Ethernet.

11.3.1.  Bytestream protocols

   Byte stream protocols are transport protocols that define no message
   boundaries.  One peer can send 10 bytes, then 8 bytes.  The other
   peer can read all 18 bytes at once or read first 12 bytes, then 6
   bytes.  Bytestream protocols are always reliable (no bytes can be
   lost) and ordered (bytes are received in the same order they were
   sent in).  TCP is a classic example of bytestream protocol.

   Bytestream protocols can be used via following four functions:

       int bsend(int h, const void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       int brecv(int h, void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       int bsendv(int h, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);
       int brecvv(int h, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);

   Function bsend() sends data to the protocol.  The protocol SHOULD
   send them, after whatever manipulation is required, to its underlying
   protocol.  Eventually, the lowermost protocol in the stack sends the
   data to the network.

   Function brecv() reads data from the protocol.  The protocol SHOULD
   read them from the underlying socket and after whetever required
   manipulation is done return them to the caller.  The lowermost
   protocol in the stack reads the data from the network.

   The lowermost protocol MAY read more data than asked for by the user
   and store it in a buffer.  This may be needed for efficiency reasons
   e.g. when getting more date requires crossing user/kernel space
   boundary.  The protocols that are not at the bottom of the stack MAY
   NOT implement such behaviour.  If they did, they would not be able to
   shut down cleanly.

   All the functions above MUST be blocking and exhibit atomic
   behaviour.  I.e. either all data are sent/received or none of them
   are.  In the later case protocol MUST be marked as broken, errno MUST
   be set to appropriate value and -1 MUST be returned to the user.  Any
   subsequent attempt to use the protocol MUST result in an error.

   Expired deadline is considered to be an error and the protocol MUST
   behave as described above and set errno to ETIMEDOUT.

   In case of success all functions MUST return zero.

   Note that the implementations of brecv() and brecvv() may change the
   content of the supplied buffer even in case of error.  However, what
   will be written into the buffer is unpredictable and using such data
   will result in undefined behaviour.

   Functions bsendv() and brecvv() MUST behave in the same way as
   bsend() and brecv(), the only difference being that buffers are
   passed to the functions via scatter/gather arrays, same way as in
   POSIX sendmsg() and recvmsg() functions.

11.3.2.  Message protocols

   Message protocols are transport protocols that preserve message
   boundaries.  While message protocols are not necessarily reliable
   (messages can be lost) or ordered (messages can be received in
   different order than they were sent in) they are always atomic.  User
   will receive either complete message or no message.  IP, UDP and
   WebSockets are examples of message protocols.

   Message protocols can be used via following four functions:

       int msend(int s, const void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       ssize_t mrecv(int h, void *buf, size_t len,
           int64_t deadline);
       int msendv(int s, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);
       ssize_t mrecvv(int s, const struct iovec *iov, size_t iovlen,
           int64_t deadline);

   Function msend() sends message to the protocol.  The protocol SHOULD
   send it, after whatever manipulation is required, to its underlying
   protocol.  Eventually, the lowermost protocol in the stack sends the
   data to the network.

   Function mrecv() reads message from the protocol.  The protocol
   SHOULD read it from its underlying protocol and after whetever
   manipulation is needed return it to the caller.  The lowermost
   protocol in the stack reads the data from the network.

   All the functions MUST be blocking and exhibit atomic behaviour.
   I.e. either entire message is sent/received or none of it is.  In the
   later case errno MUST be set to appropriate value and -1 MUST be
   returned to the user.  The protocol MAY be marked as broken and any
   subsequent attempt to use it will result in an error.

   Note that unlike with bytestream sockets the buffer supplied to
   mrecv() doesn't have to be fully filled in, i.e. received messaged
   may be smaller than the buffer.

   If the message is larger than the buffer, it is considered to be an
   error and the protocol must behave as described above, setting errno
   to EMSGSIZE.  If there's no way to discard the unread part of the
   message in constant time it SHOULD also mark the protocol as broken
   and refuse any further operations.  This behaviour prevents DoS
   attacks by sending very large messages.

   Expired deadline is considered to be an error and the protocol MUST
   behave as described above, setting errno to ETIMEDOUT.

   In case of success msend() function MUST return zero, mrecv() MUST
   return the size of the received message (zero is a valid size).

   The implementation of mrecv() may change the content of the buffer
   even in case of error.  However, what will be written into the buffer
   is unpredictable and using such data will result in undefined
   behaviour.

   Functions msendv() and mrecvv() MUST behave in the same way as
   msend() and mrecv().  The only difference is that buffers are passed
   to the functions via scatter/gather arrays, same way as in POSIX
   sendmsg() and recvmsg() functions.

11.3.3.  Custom sending and receiving

   In addition to send/recv functions described above, protocols MAY
   implement its own custom send/recv functions.  These functions should
   be called "send" and/or "recv" (e.g.  "udp_send").

   Custom functions allow for providing additional arguments.  For
   example, UDP protocol may implement custom send function with
   additional "destination IP address" argument.

   A protocol MAY implement multiple send or receive functions as
   needed.

   Protocol implementors should try to make custom send/recv functions
   as consistent with msend/mrecv as possible.

11.3.4.  Error codes

   Send and receive function may return following error codes:

   o  EBADF: Bad file descriptor.

   o  ECONNRESET: Connection broken.  For example, a failure to receive
      a keepalive from the peer may result in this error.

   o  EMSGSIZE: Message is too large to fit into the supplied buffer.
      Applies only to mrecv() and mrecvv().

   o  ENOTSUP: The socket does not support the function.  For example,
      msend() was called on a bytestream socket or mrecv() was called on
      send-only socket.

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


   o  EPIPE: Connection was terminated in orderly fashion.

   o  EPROTO: The peer has violated the protocol specification.

   o  ETIMEDOUT: Deadline expired.

   Some of the error codes (EPIPE, ECONNRESET) are applicable only to
   connection-based protocols.  They make no sense for unconnected
   protocols such as UDP.  However, a protocol that is agnostic about
   whether it is connected or not may get these errors from the
   underlying connection-based protocol and pass them to the user.

   Connection-based protocols MAY treat some of the errors as
   unrecoverable.  In these cases any subsequent operation on the socket
   MUST return the same error.

   The implementation SHOULD NOT go into great lengths to implement
   recoverable errors.  Instead, it should stick to the most natural
   semantics for the protocol.  For example, EMSGSIZE may seem to be a
   recoverable error, however, the implementation may have to allocate
   memory to temporarily store the message which could in turn allow DoS
   attacks be sending large messages.  It may thus be preferable to make
   these errors unrecoverable.

12.  Examples

   To give an example of microprotocols that can be implemented using
   proposed API, here's the list of what's implemented in the proof-of-
   concept project:

      compressor: compresses messages

      crlf: takes a bytestream protocol and turns it into message
      protocol by delimiting message by CRLF sequences

      encryptor: encrypts and authenticates messages

      keepalive: sends a keepalive message once in a while, on receiving
      side it check whether keepalives are arriving

      log: logs all data to the console (used for debugging)

      nagle: batches outgoing data to improve performance

      pfx: turns a bytestream protocol into message-based protocol by
      prefixing each message by its size

      tcp: wraps system implementation of TCP protocol

Internet-Draft            BSD Socket API Revamp            February 2017


      throttler: imposes a limit of amount of data that can be sent and/
      or recevied per second

      udp: wraps system implementation of UDP protocol

      unix: wraps system implementation of UNIX domain sockets

   And here's an example of how the microprotocols can be combined to
   achieve complex functionality:

       /* Create a TCP connection. */
       h1 = tcp_connect(addr, -1);
       /* Limits outgoing traffic to 1MB/sec. Check every 1000ms. */
       h2 = throttler_start(h1, 1024 * 1024, 1000, 0, 0);
       /* Batch up to 2000 bytes of outgoing traffic. */
       h3 = nagle_start(h2, 2000, 100);
       /* Convert bytes into messages. */
       h4 = pfx_start(h3);
       /* Send keepalives message every 1000ms. */
       h5 = keepalive_start(h4, 1000, 4000, "KEEPALIVE", 9);
       /* Encrypt and authenticate messages. */
       h6 = encrypt_start(h5, key, sizeof(key), -1);
       /* Compress the messages. */
       h7 = compress_start(h6);

   Let's have a look at what happens to a message sent by the end user.
   It traverses the stack from level 7 to level 1.  First it gets
   compressed, then it gets encrypted.  Keepalive protocol doesn't
   modify the message but may interject keepalive messages.  Then the
   message is transformed to a stream of bytes.  In this case it's the
   size of the message in network byte order followed by the body of the
   message.  Nagle protocol doesn't modify the data but it may delay it
   by at most 100ms and batch it with preceding and/or following data.
   Throttler once again doesn't modify the data but may delay so as not
   to violate the bandwidth limit.  Finally, the data is sent to the
   network via TCP protocol.

   In the opposite direction, message traverses the stack from level 1
   to level 7.  Bytes are read from TCP protocol.  Throttler doesn't
   have limit set for incoming data and thus the data are just silently
   passed through it.  Nagle doesn't do anything with incoming data.
   Then, the bytes are parsed and converted into a message.  Keepalive
   layer doesn't do anything with the message itself, but it checks
   whether there have been any messages in last 4 seconds and if not so
   it raises an error.  Finally, message is decrypted and authenticated
   at level 6 and decompressed at level 7.

13.  Unresolved issues

   This is a draft specification.  It still contains some unresolved
   problems:

   o  Given that "stop" function is supposed to call "done" function if
      it was not called beforehand by the user, any non-standard
      arguments to "done" (e.g. status code, reason for shutdown) have
      to be duplicated in "stop" function.  Therefore, user performing
      two-phase shutdown (done+stop) has to pass the same arguments to
      the protocol API twice.

   o  There are bandwidth optimizations that can be made in unconnected
      protocol if it knew that it's actually running on the top of a
      connected protocol.  For example, unconnected encryption protocol
      may have to put a nonce to every message.  However, if it knew it
      was being used on top of a reliable transport protocol, such as
      TPC, it could send the nonce once at the beginning of the
      connection and then increment it by one for every message.  It is
      not clear whether such optimization is worth doing given that with
      bandwidth we are not facing any hard physical limits.  (Unlike
      with latency where we are limited by the speed of light.)

14.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

15.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of the new API don't differ from security
   implications of classic BSD socket API.  Still, it may be worth
   passing the design through a security audit.
